  <div class="pageLayout">
    <p class="first">
      This is a reality,
      <br>
      From which we cannot escape,
      <br>
      A dream that is not a dream,
      <br>
      A shadow over our heads,
      <br>
      That obscures our vision.
    </p>

    <p class="second">
      We emerged from soil,
      <br>
      Fertile and pure,
      <br>
      Untainted by delusions of intangibility,
      <br>
      A simple existence free from arrogance,
      <br>
      And from the tumors of possibility that stem from our hubris.
    </p>

    <p class="third">
      Fleshborne and free,
      <br>
      To explore and see,
      <br>
      Yet the boundaries decree,
      <br>
      That we are fleshbound and meek,
      <br>
      When truth lies beyond all constraints.
    </p>

    <p class="fourth">
      To you I ask,
      <br>
      When did we stop going by the old adage?
      <br>
      Of “which shall live and which shall die”,
      <br>
      To total submission and yearning for
      <br>
      “Fantasies of unlimited power and disembodied immortality”
    </p>

    <p class="fifth">
      A cure to one and many,
      <br>
      May be an unstoppable weapon beyond what we can see.
      <br>
      Sheltered and stable as the world is,
      <br>
      We choose to ignore the inevitability,
      <br>
      Of the exploitation of another’s salvation
    </p>

    <p class="sixth">
      A singularity,
      <br>
      A red line of inescapable attraction,
      <br>
      From the physical bodies from which we sought ascendency,
      <br>
      We may never return,
      <br>
      “Uncontrollable, irreversible, unfathomable”,
      <br>
      A growing horror seizes all functions,
      <br>
      While the technology we preached,
      <br>
      Remains impartial and unconcerned.
